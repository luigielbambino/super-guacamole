Who are the target users? - Domain situation
People worried about their expenses and savings. Everyone who wants to spend their money more efficiently or have money saving goals. Particularly focused on young adults and older adults that are working or studying. Not necessarily skilled in management processes but with medium to high level of technology expertise, meaning that they are comfortable using desktop and mobile devices and applications.

What is shown? - Data abstraction
We receive the data of all the transactions and spendings of the user containing the amount, description, purpose, detailed purpose and date. To keep track of personal expenses and earnings we want to show how much the user has spent during a specific range of time, monthly, separating the amounts  by categories and subcategories according to the type of expenses

Why is the user looking at it? - Task abstraction
We try to help to achieve financial health by cutting unnecessary expenses. People tend to run out of money by the end of the month wondering where did it go. It is hard to remember everything you have bought, but it is even more difficult to sum all those expenses to realize how much you have spent on tiny or irrelevant things. By tracking your spending, one can realize how much money has been spent and for what purpose, and compare it in relation to the current earnings. This tool could help to make a change in the spending behavior of its users.


How is it shown? - Technique
Current apps and websites use pie charts to differentiate the category of expenses but you can only see level of categories. It is not common to dig deeper into the details of the expenses. However, with the sunburst technique it is possible to show multiple levels of attributes in of your expenses making it more clear and efficient to understand and realize how they spend their money. Discretionary spending will be shown in a sunburst technique by a time range of a month showing the percentage of money spent on each category. Subcategories will be shown in a second layer. Categories and subcategories sizes will be map to their respective percentage spent on the given range of time.
